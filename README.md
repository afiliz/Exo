# Exo: An Exoplanet Visualization
Exo is a 3D visualiztion of all of the exoplanets that NASA has discovered. It uses NASA's Exoplanet Archive API to get data on each exoplanet, then calculates their coordinates, color, and size based on that data.

In order to build this project, I used the 3D graphics library three.js along with a custom shader (in order to have points with different sizes). I built it as my capstone project for my Computer Science degree at UC Santa Cruz during the course CMPS 161: Introduction to Data Visualization. The development of the project took about 5 weeks from about mid February to mid/late March of 2019. I still plan to add features to Exo as time progresses. Currently, the next feature planned is to give the user the ability to only view exoplanets that have been declared to be in the habitable zone.

A live demo of Exo can be found [here](https://people.ucsc.edu/~afiliz/Exo/exo.html), and the documentation for how to use Exo can be found [here](https://people.ucsc.edu/~afiliz/Exo/). A technical write-up on Exo can also be found in the documentation. I hope you enjoy Exo!
